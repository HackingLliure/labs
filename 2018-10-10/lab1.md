# Lab 1

- Date: 2018-10-10
- Session overview: we want to remake our Cryptocoin educational project, and so today we are deciding what technologies and architecture to use. A former project existed, but SQLite and Nodejs were actually a pretty bad combination (ever heard of Callback Hell?).

## Review: the stack

We want to try Rust out so bad, but this project had to be web-based. Luckily we had heard of [The Neon Project](https://www.neon-bindings.com), which provides Rust bindings to use Rust code as Nodejs modules. Also, we decided to switch the database technology to Mongodb just because. The next step is to put all of this in Docker and start developing (quite from scratch).
